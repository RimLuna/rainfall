*nice, the SUID perm again*

Using **binary ninja**, found that the executable calls execve("/bin/sh")
```
mov     dword [esp], data_80c5348  {"/bin/sh"}
call    execv
```
## ROP ( Return-oriented programming) ecploit
Googled it, although I've done pwning before but still can't fucking explain anything

**The main idea is to use the existing small fragments in the program based on the stack buffer overflow. ) to change the value of some registers or variables to control the execution flow of the program.**

It's called ROP because we use the **ret** instruction to change the order in which the instruction stream is executed.

### What the fuck am I doing

```
level0@RainFall:~$ checksec --file level0 
RELRO           STACK CANARY      NX            PIE             RPATH      RUNPATH      FILE
No RELRO        No canary found   NX enabled    No PIE          No RPATH   No RUNPATH   level0
```
*NX is enabled, meaning you can't use shellcode or put anything on the stack in order to execute it.*

**binary ninja**
```
mov     dword [esp {var_30}], eax
call    atoi
cmp     eax, 0x1a7
```
*compares atoi(arg) to **0x1a7 which is 423**, I love me those compares*
```
level0@RainFall:~$ ./level0 423
$ ls
ls: cannot open directory .: Permission denied
$ getflag
/bin/sh: 2: getflag: not found
$ /bin/getflag
/bin/sh: 3: /bin/getflag: not found
```
*so it opend a shell using execv('/bin/sh'), but nothing special is happening when i execute anything*

this shit calls **setresuid** and a bunch of weird looking functions before execv
### I dont know the point of this project yeeeet, that's why I'm fucking executing getflag from the snowcrash shit
Oh so I need to find a way to read a .pass file in the next user's home directoryy

*ugh*

```
$ cat /home/user/level1/.pass
1fe8a524fa4bec01ca4ea2a869af2a02260d4a7d5fe7e7c24d8617e6dca12d3a
```
**yayyyy**
```
level0@RainFall:~$ su level1
Password:1fe8a524fa4bec01ca4ea2a869af2a02260d4a7d5fe7e7c24d8617e6dca12d3a
```
## level1
```
level1@RainFall:~$ file level1 
level1: setuid setgid ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=0x099e580e4b9d2f1ea30ee82a22229942b231f2e0, not stripped
```
*yay, good mood today*

Executable waits for input then when u enter input it fucking leaves, the fuck

**binary ninja this bitch**
```
call    gets
leave    {__saved_ebp}
retn     {__return_addr}
```
*yup gets then ret, kill me*

Buuuut there's a function run, that isn't called anywhere in the main, with a call to **system('/bin/sh')**
```
mov     dword [esp {var_1c}], data_8048584  {"/bin/sh"}
call    system
```
### how the fuck do you jump to this stupid shit
